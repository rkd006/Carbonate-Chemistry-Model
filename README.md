# Carbonate Chemistry Model
The objective of this project is to create a carbonate chemistry model that predicts CO2 losses to the atmosphere and CO2 requirements as function of pH, alkalinity, kLa, temperature and salinity from algae raceway ponds. It is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and part of the MAGIC (Marine Algae Industrialization Consortium) project headed by Duke University and Professor Zachary Johnson.

## Relevant Information and Equations
In most natural systems, acid buffering capacity is predominately made up by the carbonate system, which consists of four species - dissolved carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, bicarbonate and carbonate. Carbonic acid exists in only very small quantities and to simplify we define it as follows:

CT is defined as the total concentration of carbonate species in solution:

In addition, the carbonate species are related to each other through the following equilibrium relationships:

the molar concentration of each carbonate species is dependent on pH as shown below:

Mass transfer of carbon dioxide is a function of alkalinity and pH, based on the following equation:

<img src="images/eq9.PNG" width = 708>

Dissolved carbon dioxide concentration can be calculated as follows:

<img src="images/eq10.PNG" width = 708> 

The effect of pH, alkalinity, and algal growth rates on carbon dioxide requirements and losses to the atmosphere were modeled for a raceway pond and operated in batch mode for 4 days. A mass balance on alkalinity and the aqueous concentration of carbon dioxide results in the following equation:

<img src="images/eq11.PNG" width = 708> 

A mass balance on Ct and rearranging results in the following equation for carbon dioxide requirements:

<img src="images/eq12.PNG" width = 708>
